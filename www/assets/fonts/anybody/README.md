We need to self-host because the canvas render stuff needs all resources to be local

(EDIT: Nope, I can't get this to work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

Font files are from:

- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anybody

ATOW the downloadable font files are glitched. But you can get Anybody-Medium.ttf by decompiling Brotato with GDRETools, then look in:

`PROJECT\resources\fonts\raw\Anybody-Medium.ttf`

And you can get the whole font set from the font's github, only the stuff in the "old" directory works though
